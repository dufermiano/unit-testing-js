Unit testing with Mocha, Chai and Sinon examples

# Install dependencies
```npm install```

# To run tests with gulp
```gulp``` command is going to use the default task, that is going to run the tests and watch.
Or you can use just ```gulp mocha``` to just run or ```gulp watch-mocha``` directly.

# To run tests with grunt
```grunt``` to run the default task, that does the same as the gulp default task.
Or just ```grunt mochaTest``` or ```grunt watch```

**Make sure grunt dependencies is not broken**
